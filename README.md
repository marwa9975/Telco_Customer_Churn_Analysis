![image](image.png)   
## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING    

The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn for a telecommunications company. Customer churn, or attrition, is a critical concern for most telecom companies, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. The goal is to perform a comprehensive analysis to understand the factors contributing to customer churn and develop strategies to reduce it. 

Key Objectives:
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

* Predict Churn: Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn based on historical data.
* Identify Factors: Identify the key factors or features that influence customer churn. This will provide insights into what aspects of telecommunications company's services or customer experiences need improvement.
* Take Preventive Actions: Use the model's predictions to take preventive actions, such as targeted marketing campaigns, personalized offers, or customer support interventions, to reduce churn.
